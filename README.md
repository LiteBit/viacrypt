ViaCRYPT
========

One time message system.

Install
-------

Dependencies are handled by npm and installed like this:

    npm install

Compiling
---------

The index.html page is generated by running compile.js

    ./compile.js

Configurations are found on config.json, copy yours from
the config.json.sample

Running
-------

Should be as simple as

    ./server.js

Note that static/index.html is not served by nodejs, and
it cannot be served through `file://`, i.e. opening the file.

Supervisor
